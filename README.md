# Market Basket Association Rule Analysis

This project performs market basket analysis using the Python `apriori` library to generate association rules. The goal is to discover interesting relationships and patterns in customer purchasing behavior.

## Dataset

The dataset used for market basket analysis contains transactional data of customer purchases. Each transaction consists of a set of items purchased together. This dataset is typically in a tabular format with a transaction ID and a list of items.

## Prerequisites

Before running the market basket analysis, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python or Anaconda
- Pandas (version 1.4.2)
- `apriori` library (version 1.0.4)

## Usage

Adjust the parameters for the apriori algorithm in the script if needed, such as the minimum support and confidence thresholds.
Explore and interpret the generated association rules. These rules represent the relationships between different items based on their co-occurrence in transactions, along with support and confidence metrics.

## Evaluation

The quality of the association rules can be evaluated based on various metrics, such as support, confidence, and lift. These metrics help assess the significance and strength of the relationships between different items.
